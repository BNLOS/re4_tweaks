# re4_tweaks

### Description
A project designed to fix and tweak the "UHD" port of Resident Evil 4 on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/254700/Resident_Evil_4/).

### Current features

 * **Increase FOV** - Increases the default FOV. Useful to prevent motion sickness in some people.

 * **Fix sniper zoom** - When playing with keyboard and mouse, this fixes an annoying bug which would cause your camera to be off-center after you zoomed in with a sniper rifle.

 * **Restore pickup screen transparency** - Restores a missing effect that was present on the GameCube and Wii versions of RE4, but has been missing since the game was ported to Xbox 360.

 * **Flip items in your inventory using the keyboard** - Creates key bindings to flip (not just rotate) items when playing with a keyboard and mouse, just like you can do if you play with a controller.
    * Default bindings: 
		 * Flip up: Home
		 * Flip down: End
		 * Flip left: Insert
		 * Flip right: Page Up
