Setting INIs stored in this folder will override any settings in the main re4_tweaks INI.
(INIs are read from this folder alphabetically, and recursively across sub-directories in this folder)

This should be useful if you're creating a mod that depends on a certain re4_tweaks feature to always be enabled/disabled.
In that case you can ship a "Bin32\re4_tweaks\setting_overrides\MyCoolMod.ini" with your mod which includes the setting values you require.
(recommend including the full folder structure with your mod, Bin32 -> re4_tweaks -> setting_overrides, only the folders themselves & your override INI are needed)

Any settings in your override-INI will always override the users saved INI file, so please make sure to only include settings that your mod actually requires!
(in other words, please try to keep your override-INI trimmed down to the minimum settings needed)

This will also allow settings to be preserved across any re4_tweaks updates that might have changed the INI file.
You can use this to your advantage to keep your own personal settings saved too, just copy your re4_tweaks INI into this folder!
