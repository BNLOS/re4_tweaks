Setting INIs stored in this folder will override any settings in the main re4_tweaks INI.
(INIs are read from this folder alphabetically, and recursively across sub-directories in this folder)

This should be useful if you're creating a mod that depends on a certain re4_tweaks feature to always be enabled/disabled.
In that case you can ship a "Bin32\re4_tweaks\setting_overrides\MyCoolMod.ini" with your mod which includes the setting values you require.
(recommend including the full folder structure with your mod, Bin32 -> re4_tweaks -> setting_overrides, only the folders themselves & your override INI are needed)

This will also allow settings to be preserved across any re4_tweaks updates that might have changed the INI file.
You can use this to your advantage to keep your own personal settings saved too, just copy your re4_tweaks INI into this folder!
